## Reasoning
The design of the functions in our application replicated the idea of using a game like reward system to encourage participation.

These have been shown to be effective in promotion, being employed by companies such as McDonald's and Burger King (Hungry Jacks), with their use of famous games such as Monopoly and Uno to encourage participation from customers. We believe using games and prizes we can also encourage users to make more sustainable decisions, thus making the environmental impact of the Marathon much more mild.
